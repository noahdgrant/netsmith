# RP2350A Minimal

A port of Raspberry Pi's open **RP2350A Minimal** reference board to netsmith, as a showcase.
**The port is in progress.** `src/main.nsm` is a placeholder board (an LED on a supply) that
stands in until the parts and the circuit are written; it is not Raspberry Pi's circuit.

## Source

- The design: <https://pip.raspberrypi.com/documents/RP-010328-CA>, a zip of the KiCad 10
  schematic, board, project, a PDF and a bill of materials.
- Name and revision: `RPI-RP2350A-MINIMAL_R4-S1`. The board file is revision R4 and the
  schematic is revision S1; both title blocks are dated 2026-07-03 ("RP2350A QFN-60 Minimal
  Design Example"). One schematic sheet, 43 parts, two copper layers.
- Licence: MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Raspberry Pi Ltd. The notice is in `LICENSE`, as they ship
  it, and stays with every copy of anything in this folder that comes from their design
  (`reference/`).

**The circuit is Raspberry Pi's. The port, the netsmith source and the tools in this folder
are netsmith's** (MIT, like the rest of the repository).

## Goal

1. **The same nets.** `netsmith compare` says the schematic of the port and Raspberry Pi's
   design are the same circuit.
2. **A matching PCB where it matters.** A board made by `netsmith fab` is interchangeable
   with theirs in these ways, and a checker with tolerances will fail when one is off:
   - the board outline and the four mounting holes;
   - the connectors (J1 to J4), the buttons (SW1, SW2) and the pin headers: the same
     positions, rotations and pads, with each header pin carrying the same signal.

   The other parts (MCU, flash, crystal, regulator, inductor, decoupling) may be anywhere,
   and the routing will differ; the checker reports them and does not fail on them.

## What is here

- `netsmith.toml`, `src/main.nsm`: the project and its (placeholder) board.
- `LICENSE`: Raspberry Pi's licence text.
- `reference/RPI-RP2350A-MINIMAL_R4-S1.kicad_pcb`: their board file, unchanged (1.6 MB).
- `reference/placements.toml`: the facts the checker needs, read from that file: the outline,
  the mounting holes and, for every footprint, its place, rotation and pads. The header of the
  file says what the origin and axes are, and which entries must match (`must_match = true`).
  Regenerate it with
  `cargo run -p netsmith --example reference_table -- reference/RPI-RP2350A-MINIMAL_R4-S1.kicad_pcb > reference/placements.toml`
  (run from this folder); a test checks that the file is what the program prints.

## Run it

From this folder:

```sh
netsmith build    # the schematic, in out/
netsmith fab      # the package for the board house, in fab/
```

`netsmith compare` can read their board file as one side:
`netsmith compare reference/RPI-RP2350A-MINIMAL_R4-S1.kicad_pcb out/Rp2350Minimal/Rp2350Minimal.kicad_sch`
says nothing useful until the port is finished.
